# Matrix-Differentiation
Matrix factorization differentiation rules (with respect to parameters) that are used for the KF-based score evaluation for solving the parameter estimation problem.
# References
Each code (implementation method) includes the exact reference where the particular algorithm was published. If you use these codes in your research, please, cite the corresponding articles mentioned in the codes.
# Remark
The codes have been presented here for their instructional value only. They have been tested with care but are not guaranteed to be free of error and, hence, they should not be relied on as the sole basis to solve problems.
